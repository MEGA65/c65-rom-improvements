# MEGA65 Improved C65 ROMs

The original C65 ROMs were never finished, and of course also do not take advantage of MEGA65 enhancements.

The purpose of this repository is to track our work on improving those ROMs in these ways, and in particular to provide a repository where issues, suggestions etc with the improved ROMs can be tracked.

However because of the copyright in the original ROMs, we cannot share the source code for our changes here, nor distribute the improved ROMs.  We _can_ however share diff files that allow transforming a specific version of C65 ROM into our improved ROMs that are created using a special programme we wrote that makes sure none of the original copyright ROM is included in the diff file.
